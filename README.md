## To Do

* Make a Datepicker component (maybe change `src/helpers/` to `src/components/` as well)
  * Consider supporting Year, Month, Date, and maybe Time pickers
* Look into hosting. These are some options:
  * [Surge](https://github.com/sintaxi/surge)
  * [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
  * [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
  * [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)
  * [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co)
  * And of course the good old [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or ...
  * ... [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages)

## App Structure

The `public/index.html` is where our Svelte components will be injected. To play with any global CSS, go to `public/global.css`. I have added another CSS file `public/classes.css` that defines helper CSS classes to be applied to any element for consistent styling. The other bundle files in `public/` are generated by Svelte upon build.

The rest of the important code live inside `src/`. The `components/` directory houses all the reusable UI components, such as a datepicker, nav links, etc. The `helpers/` contain more abstracted components, such as for layouts, etc. `main.js` is the entry point of our app. `db.js` connects Mammon Manager to PouchDB and CouchDB (if you have the latter setup). `router.js` gives us simple routing capabilities. The rest of the `.svelte` files are the main building blocks of Mammon Manager.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd mammon-manager
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Deploying to the web

### With [now](https://zeit.co/now)

Install `now` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g now
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
cd public
now
```

As an alternative, use the [Now desktop client](https://zeit.co/download) and simply drag the unzipped project folder to the taskbar icon.

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
npm run build
surge public
```
